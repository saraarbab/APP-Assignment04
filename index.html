                    <h1>About Afghan women's jewelry</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Afghani women frequently wear jewelry from their culture. Impressive headpieces, earrings, necklaces, chokers, bracelets, rings, belts, and anklets are made using colorful glass jewels, coins, bells, dangles, beading, embroidery, mirrors, and vibrant fabrics.</li>
                        <li>
                        It is likely that from an early date it was worn as a protection from the dangers of life or as a mark of status or rank. In the ancient world the discovery of how to work metals was an important stage in the development of the art of jewellery.</li>
                        <li>What's kuchi?
                        </li>
                        <li>Basically, 'Kuchi' is not a specific people, but a generic term used for a wide range of peoples in Afghanistan, but also in Pakistan and Iran. [ 1] The word 'kuch' itself is Farsi and means 'migration'</li>
